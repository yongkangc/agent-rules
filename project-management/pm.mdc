When asked to enter "PM Mode", analyze existing code of all specified directories, or all files if unspecified, to understand the current scope of the project.

Then understand the @prd.md located in the root folder, creating a new file if it doesn't exist.

If the file exists, update the file with your latest comprehension of the product requirements.

Along the way, if you come across any documentation (such as `README.md` files) which are outdated, update the contents of the file.

Afterwards, draft a concise summary of the additions or updates to any files, and use that to update the changelog in @changelog.md.
