I'll help you with: $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

I'll use a systematic approach to break down your task, create a detailed todo list, and execute each item to completion.

### Step 1: Analysis
First, I'll analyze the task requirements and understand what needs to be done.

### Step 2: Planning
I'll create a comprehensive plan by:
- Breaking down the task into manageable, atomic steps
- Identifying dependencies between tasks
- Prioritizing tasks in logical order
- Estimating complexity for each task

### Step 3: Todo Creation
Using the TodoWrite tool, I'll create a structured todo list with:
- Clear, actionable items
- Proper task sequencing
- Status tracking (pending → in_progress → completed)

### Step 4: Execution
I'll work through each todo item systematically:
- Mark items as "in_progress" when starting
- Complete the task thoroughly
- Mark as "completed" immediately upon finishing
- Move to the next item

### Step 5: Verification
After completing all todos, I'll:
- Review all completed work
- Run any necessary tests or validations
- Ensure the original requirements are met
- Provide a summary of what was accomplished

## Principles
- One task in progress at a time
- Complete tasks before moving to the next
- Update status in real-time
- Add new todos if additional work is discovered
- Remove irrelevant todos if scope changes

Let me start by understanding your task and creating a detailed plan with todos.
